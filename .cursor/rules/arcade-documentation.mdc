Use the official Arcade documentation and given examples from Arcade documentation like Simple platformer and Pymunk platformer. Use that code as an inspiration for current changes.
This is the link to the correct Arcade Documentation https://api.arcade.academy/en/latest/tutorials/platform_tutorial/step_12.html
As you can notice we're using latest arcade in this project. 
Only use other sources if you tried hard enough browsing the official documentation and not found a solution in the official arcade documentation. You should ask permision before browsing other sources.
